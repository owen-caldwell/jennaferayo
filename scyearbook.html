                        <b>SC YEARBOOK</b> VOL 1.<br>
                        2022<br>
                        <br>
                        I made this yearbook to give credit to the kids that push
                        me to stay true to my ambitions. Some of these people
                        I have known since middle school, and some of them I
                        met minutes before I took their picture. Yet every single
                        person in here showed out and wanted to be a part of my
                        art without knowing what the project was even about!
                        that's so wild 2 me... Soooo this book pays homage to
                        you! the youth! Who I am and who I want to be as an
                        artist, creator, and human are not feasible without the
                        creatives that surround me. To everyone that supports
                        me: I am forever grateful for your kindness and generosity. 
                        So, without futher ado... Drumroll please. the offcial,
                        first-ever, top of the line, for the youth by the youth,
                        STRAIGHT CREEPS YEARBOOK: VOLUME 1.
                        Wow! What a delight!! As many of you may know, I am a
                        maximalist with my work. However for this book, I (reluctantly) 
                        challenged myself to be a minimalist; Putting
                        as much emphasis on the faces within it. I asked each
                        participant to write down their name, age, where they
                        are from, what they do, and any other information they
                        would like to share with you. Yes, you. the Reader! I also
                        told them to dress in their favorite outfits. This way, you
                        can truly see the persona being presented to you. Each
                        person shines a very special light. I hope you enjoy. Thx!<br>
